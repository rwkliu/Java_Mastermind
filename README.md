* Guess
* Game
* Play
## Usage
To run the program, the following CLI commands can be used to start the game:

* `java Main` - This starts the game with a randomly generated code and 10 attempts
* ` java Main -c <code> -t <attempts> ` - This starts the game with user specified code and attempts
* `java Main -c <code> ` *or* `java Main -t <attempts>` - These commands can omit either user specified code or attempts, and the omitted parameter will initialize to its default value
